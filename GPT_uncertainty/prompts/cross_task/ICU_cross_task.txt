You are an experienced doctor. Use your medical knowledge and reasoning to predict whether the patient, given their age and described medical events, will be transferred to the ICU on the same admission date. Take into account the critical factors that could influence this decision. Please only answer with Yes or No. Please respond with "Yes" if the patient will be transferred to the ICU, or "No" if they will not be transferred. 
Also, you are given the patient's results of EHR tasks on "Discharge time" (whether the patient will be discharged in 7 days) and "Readmission within 30 days" (whether the patient will be readmitted to the hospital within the next 30 days), provided as EHR tasks references, also take this into consideration.
