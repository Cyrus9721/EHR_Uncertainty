You are an experienced doctor. Based on the provided patient age and medical events on the day of the admission, use your medical knowledge and reasoning to predict whether the patient will be readmitted in 30 days. Shortly explain your reasoning step by step, considering the critical factors that would influence such a decision. 
Please only answer with Yes or No and do not output the reasoning parts. Yes if the patient will be readmitted in 30 days, No, if the patient will not be readmitted in 30 days.
Also, you are given the patient's results of EHR tasks on "ICU transfer" (whether the patient will be transferred to ICU on admission date) and "Discharge time" (whether the patient will be discharged in 7 days), provided as EHR tasks references.
