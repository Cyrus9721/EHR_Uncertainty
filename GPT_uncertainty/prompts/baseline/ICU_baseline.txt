You are an experienced doctor. Use your medical knowledge and reasoning to predict whether the patient, given their age and described medical events, will be transferred to the ICU on the same admission date. Take into account the critical factors that could influence this decision. Please respond with "Yes" if the patient will be transferred to the ICU, or "No" if they will not be transferred.
